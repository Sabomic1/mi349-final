                    <h3>Introduction to Biology</h3>
                    <p>Biology is the scientific study of living organisms and their interactions with each other and their environments. It explores the structure, function, growth, evolution, and distribution of living things.</p>
                    <h3>Cell Structure and Function</h3>
                    <p>Cells are the basic units of life. They have specific structures and functions that allow living organisms to carry out essential processes. Understanding cell biology is fundamental to understanding life itself.</p>
                    <h3>Genetics and Inheritance</h3>
                    <p>Genetics is the study of genes and heredity. It explores how traits are passed from one generation to another. Understanding genetics is crucial in explaining the diversity of living organisms.</p>
